# Day 5 revision: Groups and assignments

A group called “Sales Employees” sounds clear, but its name does not enforce anything. Look at how people enter the group and what access that membership actually gives them.

## The concepts to keep with you

**Group.** A group collects users so they can be managed together. Membership may come from a rule, a manual decision, or an external source. Find the membership owner before trying to change it.

**Group rule.** A rule evaluates conditions to determine membership. Northbridge's normal Sales rule checks the Okta profile for both `department = Sales` and `workerType = Employee`. The word **AND** matters: both must be true. Using OR would admit people who meet only one condition.

**Rule state and user state.** An active rule is enabled to operate. That is different from a user having an Active status. Neither observation replaces checking the user's actual membership and any applicable exclusion.

**Application assignment.** Assignment establishes a user's relationship to an application in Okta. It may come through a group or directly. It remains separate from creating a target account, completing sign-in, and receiving permissions inside the target.

**Multiple assignment paths.** A user can retain an assignment through another group or a direct assignment after leaving one group. To understand removal, inspect every remaining path and its approval.

**Group Push.** Group Push manages supported downstream group objects and memberships. It serves a different purpose from application assignment. Use separate groups for assignment and Group Push as taught in the course; do not assume the Salesforce example has Group Push configured.

## Walk through the people

Maya is a Sales employee, so she meets the normal rule. Priya is a Sales contractor, so she fails the employee condition. Daniel is a Finance employee, so he fails the Sales condition. An OR rule would include all three for different reasons.

If Priya nevertheless has a direct application assignment, that does not prove the rule included her. It tells you to inspect a separate access path and its approval. Do not change her worker type just to make the normal rule include her.

Later, when Maya moves to Finance, losing Sales-group membership does not by itself prove she lost Salesforce assignment. A direct assignment may remain. Follow membership to assignment and then to the target outcome rather than stopping at the first change.

## When a request reaches you

When membership exists but assignment is absent, inspect the actual group-to-application relationship. A direct exception can hide that defect and later survive removal from the normal group.

## Check your understanding

- Which profile supplies the values for the normal Sales rule?
- Why might Salesforce assignment remain after Sales-group removal?
- How is Group Push different from using a group to assign an application?

<summary>Compare your reasoning</summary>

1. The rule reads the Okta user profile. A different value in Workday or an app user profile is not the rule's current input.

2. Another group or a direct assignment may still provide access. Check all paths and their approval before claiming assignment removal.

3. Group Push manages supported groups and memberships in the target. Group-based assignment establishes application assignment in Okta. These responsibilities use separate groups in the taught design.
