# Course glossary

Use these short reminders alongside the examples. The linked lessons explain the relationships and limits.

## Course context

|---|---|
| Okta organization / org / tenant | A separate Okta environment with its own users and configuration. |
| OIE | Okta Identity Engine, the engine used for this course's product explanations. |
| Evidence packet | A set of supplied case facts. An independent variation changes only the stated facts for that question. |

## People and access (Day 1)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| IAM | Identity and access management: managing identities and the access they should receive. |
