# Day 15: Investigate Northbridge as a connected system

Northbridge has several open identity tickets. Some have a demonstrated technical defect. Others still need an ownership or approval decision. One concerns access that remains available after a departure.

Your task is to explain what each record establishes, decide what needs attention first, and give the responsible owners a useful next action.

## Work from the packet

Read the [final case evidence](../assessments/final-case.md), then complete the [seven investigation tasks](../exercises/day-15.md). Keep your reasoning separate from the [model answers](../self-checks/day-15.md) until you have attempted the tasks.

The final case supplies its own investigation snapshots. Maya is now in Finance and Jordan has departed; the archived AD incident explicitly predates his departure. Do not replace a case observation with the result of an earlier lesson's independent example.

You may use the [company reference](../reference/northbridge-company.md), [ownership reference](../reference/attribute-ownership.md), [glossary](../reference/glossary.md), and your earlier notes. Record where you needed help so you can choose a useful review afterward.

## Write a defensible investigation

For each ticket, explain:

- The approved outcome, or the approval decision that is missing.
- The relevant person, application instance, account, and operation.
- What is observed and the first demonstrated discrepancy, if one is established.
- Which explanation is supported, which remains a hypothesis, and which evidence would distinguish alternatives.
- The next action and its responsible owner.
- The result needed before reporting resolution, including target access where relevant.

Use the packet's evidence labels in your answer. “Inspect A4's transmitted value and target result” is more useful than “check the logs.” An unresolved conclusion is appropriate when the evidence cannot support a cause or approval.

## Prioritize by the supplied impact

State what you would investigate or escalate first and why. Distinguish ongoing inappropriate access from incorrect data, blocked business work, and an archived incident. Several owners can work independently; ranking attention does not require leaving other tickets untouched.

A proposed correction is not a completed correction. Do not invent a successful retry, an approval, or a target read to make your final report look complete.

## Explain the architecture in ordinary language

Alongside the tickets, explain how employee data reaches Okta, how contractor identities coexist with that model, and how assignments, sign-in, provisioning, and sessions have different responsibilities. Connect at least one complete mover or leaver story to the evidence.

After your attempt, read the [answers](../self-checks/day-15.md) and use the [final debrief and skills checklist](../assessments/self-checks/final-case.md). Revise any conclusion that exceeded the evidence, then try the changed-condition questions without copying the model reasoning.

## Close the request without hiding an unknown

Use five short statements: what was expected, what was observed, what explains the demonstrated discrepancy, what was changed or handed off, and what was verified. Include the relevant person, application instance, and attempt or effective point. An explanation should remain understandable to someone who did not watch the investigation.

For Jordan, a completed Projects correction cannot close Expense's remaining access. Name the Expense owner and the exact outstanding check. For Priya, an approval question needs a business decision; a username conflict needs identity and resource evidence. Do not merge them into “contractor issue.”

Try the unfamiliar situations in [Working through requests](../requests/index.md). First choose your checks without opening the reasoning. Afterward, compare whether your action followed from the supplied evidence, whether you considered other affected users, and whether your verification actually tested the requested outcome.

## Keep the explanations you can reuse

Consolidate [your notebook](../notebook/guide.md) into an architecture explanation, an investigation record, and an access-decision record. Mark uncertainties clearly and name the next evidence you would need.

Distinguish a proposed next action from an action already performed. Record the outcome as verified only when the supplied evidence supports it.

The [optional extension reference](../reference/optional-extensions.md) introduces terms you may encounter beyond these investigations. It is not required to answer the case.
