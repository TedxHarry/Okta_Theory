# Day 7: Self-check answers

Attempt the [exercises](../exercises/day-07.md) first. Keep configuration, enrollment, authentication evidence, and application authorization separate.

## 1. Count proof, not prompts

Both passwords represent knowledge. Two knowledge checks do not establish different factor types. Password plus the stated registered-device possession method represents knowledge and possession, assuming each is successfully validated.

The number of screens does not identify the kinds of proof. A supported interaction may also establish multiple factors without multiple separate prompts.

Revisit **Why a password may not be enough** if your answer counted screens instead of evidence.

## 2. Installed but not enrolled

Availability and installation are established; the required Northbridge account enrollment is missing. The prompt is consistent with that gap. Another organization's account is a different association.

Verify completion through the approved enrollment process for Daniel's correct account and supported device. There is no password or department defect in the supplied evidence.

Revisit **Separate availability, enrollment, and use** if you treated installed software as an enrolled credential.

## 3. Required enrollment

Enrollment governs registration. Authentication requirements govern the proof needed for an attempt. The fact that Daniel must register an authenticator does not establish every application's challenge frequency or method requirements.

Inspect the actual applicable requirement, relevant prior-authentication/session context, and the attempt's decision and results. Detailed policy mechanics are not required for this answer.

Revisit **Two requirements with different jobs** if required enrollment became “challenge on every visit.”

## 4. Issued is not accepted

The packet establishes accepted password evidence, enrollment, and an issued Push request. It does not establish delivery, approval, or successful response validation.

Possible explanations include delivery failure or a received request that Daniel denied. Request the relevant delivery/device and response evidence for D-2. A recorded denial would support a different investigation from evidence that the notification never reached the selected device. Neither cause is proven by the packet.

The accepted password result does not support a wrong-password correction. Revisit **Enrollment does not answer a challenge**.

## 5. Same app, different method

TOTP is not Push, and an unrelated event is not evidence for the identified attempt. The supplied requirement explicitly calls for Push; a generic Okta Verify label does not satisfy that reasoning gap.

Obtain the accepted Push result tied to the relevant user, enrollment, and attempt, together with the decision that the stated requirement was satisfied.

Revisit **Okta Verify methods are not interchangeable** and Day 2's event-context explanation.

## 6. FastPass without a password

None of those conclusions follows. FastPass uses cryptographic authentication through Okta Verify. Absence of a typed password does not establish absence of proof, factor count, or AD password validation.

Inspect the actual method, supported flow, required properties, user-verification evidence where relevant, and validation result. FastPass and Push are distinct experiences; neither an enabled setting nor a product name proves a particular requirement was met.

Revisit **Where FastPass fits** if passwordless became synonymous with single-factor or no authentication.

## 7. Write a precise update

A supported update is:

> Your enrollment is complete, and the password and Push checks satisfied the stated requirement for D-3. We still need to establish what Expense accepted and which application permissions you have. If you can enter Expense but cannot approve, we will compare the approval requirement with your permissions and the application's denial evidence.

If application entry itself is unknown, obtain that observation before treating the problem as a proven permission issue. Authentication success does not establish provisioning, target account state, or approval authority.

Revisit Day 1's Daniel example and **Keep the evidence tied to the question** if you inferred full access from completed authentication.

## Ready to continue

Explain available → enrolled → required for this attempt → accepted result, then name the remaining application checks. If any arrow depends on an assumption, identify it. That prepares you to examine the sign-in information an application receives in Day 8.
