# Day 11: Self-check answers

Attempt the [exercises](../exercises/day-11.md) first. Use the supplied evidence rather than a familiar name alone.

## 1. Separate the outcomes

Discovery and a proposed comparison have occurred. Confirmation is pending, so this packet does not establish the proposed association was accepted. It also provides no activation or application-entry result. Some configurations automate these stages, but this packet explicitly has not completed confirmation.

Revisit **Separate the stages**.

## 2. Choose from evidence

A meets the selected employeeNumber comparison and Northbridge's additional ownership and uniqueness checks. B is a different person's record. The supported proposal is to confirm A against Maya's existing identity through the approved process; M-1 alone does not prove that confirmation happened.

M-2 supplies successful confirmation, the checked association, and the target's current account state. It still supplies no sign-in. Revisit **Work through Maya's existing account**.

## 3. Handle conflicting identifiers

The comparison value is duplicated, and ownership is unresolved. Equality does not repair bad or ambiguous data. Request authoritative identifier history, account-creation evidence, and the application owner's ownership evidence. Decide whether there is an incorrect value, two legitimate records for different purposes, or an actual duplicate only after investigating.

Do not select the first candidate, create a third record, or delete either candidate merely to clear ambiguity. Revisit **Recognize when the evidence is insufficient**.

## 4. Explain a missing result

An out-of-scope account can be absent by design. Compare its location and the approved population before proposing a scope change. No agent defect follows from this observation alone.

A missing comparison value prevents the intended match; it does not establish that a new person exists. Investigate the authoritative value and its mapping or delivery. Revisit **Start with scope and direction** and **A matching rule is a comparison, not a biography**.

## 5. Revisit profile ownership

Maya's Projects association identifies a downstream account. Projects is not a configured profile source, so the association does not replace Workday ownership. Workday and AD associations, priority, and the AD email exception retain their stated roles.

An erroneous Priya-to-AD association is different because AD is a configured source and Priya is meant to be excluded. Inspect the resulting effective source, attribute ownership, actual writes, and the confirmation history. Do not invent a Workday association or assume the contractor label blocks sourcing.

A global priority change can affect other users without correcting the mistaken link. Investigate and restore the intended relationship through the supported process, then verify values and affected access. Revisit **Association can affect sourcing**.

## 6. Read incomplete and denied evidence

The first result is one page of Okta users with another page available. It does not establish Priya is absent. Follow the service's next link and consider the query's scope before a completeness claim.

The second attempt is a denied read with a supplied permission cause, not a successful empty list. Request an appropriately authorized read. Neither result is a Projects account inventory or a record of Priya's account association. Revisit **Read the whole result, not just its first page**.

## 7. Compare import, JIT, and reconciliation

The Projects import reads existing target records and proposes or confirms their relationship with Okta identities. A configured JIT flow creates or updates an account during sign-in: application-side JIT acts in the application, whereas an enabled AD-to-Okta JIT path acts on an Okta profile. These are distinct destinations and capabilities.

SSO success alone does not prove account creation or which mechanism produced an account. Reconciliation compares intended identities and associations with observed records, checks missing or duplicate relationships, verifies current values and relevant states, and leaves unresolved ownership explicit. Confirmation alone is not proof that every related application now works.

Revisit **Reconcile expected and observed records** and **Compare import with just-in-time creation**.

## Optional changed condition

In M-1, candidate A's email now differs from Maya's current email. The employee number, authoritative ownership history, and uniqueness checks remain valid. Must Alex create a new account?

<details>
<summary>Check the reasoning</summary>

No. The configured comparison is employeeNumber, not email. Investigate the email difference and its intended owner, but a changed address does not by itself overturn the verified identity relationship. If email participates in another sign-in or mapping rule, check that consequence separately. Do not assume the discrepancy is harmless for every operation or that it proves another person.
