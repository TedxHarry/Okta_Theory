# Day 15: Model investigation

Attempt the [tasks](../exercises/day-15.md) before reading. Equivalent reasoning is acceptable when it follows the packet. A missing approval or cause should remain missing in the answer.

## 1. Explain the environment and priorities

Workday controls the employee profile through the user's applicable association and the configured source order. AD is second, but it explicitly controls designated employee work email. That field exception does not transfer employee lifecycle ownership to AD. AD also validates passwords on the delegated path through the agent; importing data and validating a password are separate operations.

Priya's profile remains Okta-managed because she has no applicable Workday or AD association and employee imports exclude her population. Sponsor approval is a business process, not a technical profile-source integration. An accidental association could affect this model and would require investigation.

Assignments establish Okta access relationships. SAML and OIDC carry different authentication information for application validation. SCIM manages target identity resources. Application sessions and permissions require application-side evidence. B5 establishes Expense entry, not another application's approval or provisioning result.

Ticket D merits first attention: the departure is effective and protected access is demonstrably still available. The Projects owner must resolve the active target after a failed operation, while the Expense owner investigates and terminates the relevant retained access. IAM coordinates the evidence and required scope.

B also warrants prompt approval review because contractor access is working without supplied authorization evidence; the packet does not prove that approval is absent in reality. C blocks Daniel's Finance work. A affects an allocation report, and E blocks the required correct Projects-account outcome. Their owners can investigate concurrently. F is an archived review rather than a current restoration request.

Other orderings among B, C, A, and E are defensible if tied to stated impact and unresolved risk. Do not invent a financial deadline, active attack, or discovered approval to justify the ranking. A useful handoff says which outcomes are confirmed, which access remains, and which decisions or technical fixes are outstanding.

## 2. Investigate Maya's move

A1 and A2 agree on the correct Finance value. A3 is the first demonstrated wrong representation: the fixed outbound mapping produces SAL. A4 confirms that SAL was sent and stored; the target did not reject it. A5 is consistent with that wrong stored value and does not turn this into a sign-in incident.

Replace the fixed value with the approved department-to-code conversion. Keep correct HR and Okta data unchanged. Verify the saved mapping with Finance and other supported inputs, Maya's app profile, the actual update to prj-1042, the target FIN value, and the corrected report outcome. Preserve her intended existing account and approved access.

Review the other users sharing the mapping and identify which actually received incorrect values. Recovery needs a known approved configuration and a plan to correct affected target values; reverting configuration alone would not establish that previous writes were reversed. A functioning login neither validates department data nor proves the required reporting result.

## 3. Investigate Priya's Salesforce access

B1 to B2 show the expected employee-only rule result: Sales AND Employee excludes a Sales contractor. B3 supplies a separate individual assignment. B4 proves actual entry through the checked Salesforce account, but not its business authorization.

Request the named approver, current exception decision, eligible contractor population, allowed application actions, owner, and end condition. Clarify whether executives are excluded, included normally, or given specific different permissions. Do not interpret the phrase as permission to bypass authentication requirements.

If a valid scoped exception is confirmed, check that the observed access fits it and that removal is managed. If the responsible owner confirms no authorization, arrange approved removal and verify all applicable assignment, target, and session outcomes. If approval remains unresolved, state the open decision and accountable owner; do not invent approval or declare a rule defect.

B5 proves its supplied Expense authentication, validation, account association, and entry outcome. It does not authorize Salesforce, prove Projects account creation, or establish all internal permissions. A valid approval for one application is not a transferable approval for another.

## 4. Investigate Daniel's SAML failure

C1 establishes the applicable Okta authentication requirements were met. C2 establishes response issuance. C3 to C4 identify the audience mismatch and Salesforce's rejection: test was sent where production was expected. The signature and time checks are independently reported as accepted. C5 supplies a matching configured user identifier, but the attempt still fails validation before a Salesforce session is established.

Review and correct the emitted audience configuration for the intended production integration against the approved expected value. Check shared impact, then verify a new correlated response, target acceptance, correct account association, actual entry, and the required reporting permission.

The packet does not demonstrate bad credentials or a missing target account. Resetting Daniel's password or creating a second account would not fix the audience mismatch. Decoded assertion fields alone would not prove signature validity; here the separate validation report supplies that result.

## 5. Investigate Jordan's departure

D1 establishes the effective source event reached the correct lifecycle path. D2 confirms completed Okta deactivation, removed app assignments, and blocked fresh Okta sign-in. D3 confirms the checked AD account is disabled. These are completed parts of the requirement.

D4 shows a failed Projects operation and a still-active target. Ask the connector and application owners for the correlated service failure and current resource state, establish an approved correction or supported retry, and verify the intended account reaches inactive state and the required access outcome. Do not infer a particular outage cause from 503.

D5 shows retained authenticated Expense access after deactivation. D6 leaves its removal and session mechanics unresolved. The Expense owner should identify the precise account/session, inspect the supported account and session controls, complete the authorized removal, and verify that the checked old session no longer serves protected data. Include other sessions and routes if the departure requirement covers them. Daniel's Day 13 example is not proof of Jordan's specific cause.

Deleting the Okta identity is a separate irreversible action and does not prove either target issue is fixed. Reactivating Jordan would conflict with the effective departure and would not establish a repair of Projects' service failure. A later successful Projects operation would still leave Expense unresolved without its own evidence.

A suitable leaver explanation follows the source event, Okta state, assignments, linked target states, failed operation, and observed session. It ends with the actual remaining work, not a claim that all access ended.

## 6. Investigate the Projects conflict

E3 establishes that Projects reported a uniqueness conflict for the create. It does not identify the conflicting account's owner or prove a correctly linked Priya account exists. E2's earlier no-match result does not explain the discrepancy by itself.

Request the full lookup filter/result, exact instance and sequence, competing creation history, and the conflicting resource with reliable ownership evidence. Another process creating the record between lookup and create is one hypothesis. A lookup/filter or visibility defect is another. Different observations would support different explanations; neither is a supplied fact.

The proposed numbered username is not an approved correction. It might create a duplicate for the same person or conceal another person's conflicting record. If the record belongs to Priya, evaluate supported existing-account handling. If it belongs to someone else, correct the approved naming or data problem through its owner. Confirm the association, applicable operation result, target state, and eventual access before closing the ticket.

Priya's approved Projects exception establishes an access requirement, not permission to take over an unverified account or evidence of a Salesforce exception.

## 7. Interpret the historical AD incident

F1 confirms only the earlier scoped import. F2 establishes that the handling agent reached the domain controller for this attempt. F3 establishes a credential-validation rejection, but leaves its reason unspecified. Request the correlated directory result and relevant account/credential conditions at that historical point. “Wrong password” is a possible explanation, not the supplied conclusion. F4 supplies no application entry.

In the changed connectivity packet, there is no credential result because the request did not reach a successful directory validation outcome. Investigate the demonstrated connectivity boundary before proposing a credential correction. Neither a successful import nor a connection failure proves that the password is correct.

Both are historical reasoning exercises. Jordan is now departed; resolving an earlier cause does not authorize restoring current access.
